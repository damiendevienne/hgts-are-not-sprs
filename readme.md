# Code and data associated with the article "HGTs are not SPRs..." by Tannier, Tricou, and de Vienne.

Here are the functions (R language) used for performing the simulations associated with the article "HGTs are not SPRs: In the presence of ghost lineages, series of Horizontal Gene Transfers do not result in series of Subtree Pruning and Regrafting", and the data produced with these functions (file `allresults`). 


- `InferTransfersAfterSamplingCorrectly.R` contains a collection of functions for the computation of "induced transfers" from a tree, a list of ghost species and a list of HGTs. It also contains multiple related functions for tree manipulation.
- `Simulations.R` contains the few functions used to (i) compute all the results presented in the article and saved in the file `allresults`, and (ii) plot the results.
